"We discussed how to increase engagement for open enrollment courses, gen ed courses where people ""have"" to be there. Referred to teaching@osu module 4."
"Discussed how to translate grading policies that focus on process with the student who is reluctant to take risk or ""fail"" at something."
We planned future meetings to discuss admin hats/time management.
"We discussed the introductory module and module 1. Went over teaching at OSU, goals for FIT mentorship program, resources available. "
"OSU bureaucracy, esp as confusing to new instructors; FIT program; the questions posed for Module 1"
"The primary purpose of our meeting was to get to know each other and share any challenges we were facing in our teaching now.  Two of my three mentees were teaching, The third won't be teaching until Spring.  Major concerns included work-life balance (two of my three mentees didn't feel that they had any), the frustration of having too many new preps and no chance to teach a course again, knowing how one is doing as a teacher, engaging students who seem indifferent. We touched on principles of UDL. The particular challenges of BIPOC instructors came up, especially instructors not trained in the US.  The meeting went very well--my three mentees seemed to value the opportunity to voice their concerns and frustrations; they gave each other valuable tips and I directed them to teaching resources.  We spent quite a bit of time on the value of midterm evaluations.  Oh, and they wondered whether it's okay to ask to visit a senior colleague's class.  One would like me to visit his class and give me some feedback.  He'll be sending me a syllabus and we'll arrange a time.  I gave everybody my phone number and emphasized that I am happy to meet with them individually, visit classes, and support in any other way in addition to our monthly cohort meetings.  We agreed to same time, same place (Wexner, Heirloom, 2PM), next meeting set for October 21.  Some major takeaways: staying positive, using mistakes as learning opportunities, appreciating the importance of self-care.  "
"We spent time getting to know each other and discussing goals and structure for the FIT mentorship. Some of the conversations evolved into discussing course structure, design, and setting. Future meetings for AU 22 were set with invites sent. "
"Salgueo Bagues, Victoria Williams and Yi-Chu Wu attended. Everyone introduced themselves and we got to know each other. Each described their positions and responsibilities at OSU and what they hoped to get out of the class. I encouraged them to do the work required to get the Drake Institute endorsement by our next meeting. We will  discuss the first module next meeting and be flexible with what we want to work on  this year. Our next meeting is scheduled  for October 19."
This was our first meeting of the year:
"-we introduced ourselves (field, years/types of teaching experience, teaching responsibilities (now or in the coming semesters), etc.)"

"Using some of the prompts in Module 1 on Carmen, we..."
-declared our expectations (what is a question about our teaching that we would like to answer this year?)
-discussed the available resources at OSU that support professional development in terms of teaching (using the list included in the module; and also a recent email sent out by ODTI)
-shared some ideas about good teaching models --what we like about what we do and/or what we have admired in other teachers that we've seen
-discussed how we wanted to proceed --i.e.  by taking the Teaching Inventory and. reviewing Module 2 before our next meeting in October.
